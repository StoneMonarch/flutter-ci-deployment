# Flutter CI Workflow Testing

This GitHub actions workflow is to show how to do a basic deployment of a flutter application to a GitHub release page. Releases are build on version tags starting with `'v*'`

This was only for learning. The flutter app that is available to download is just the default counter application. That being said you can now install it on Windows, Linux, Android, or Web.
